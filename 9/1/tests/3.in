the goal of the game is to rotate the faces of the cube in such a 


way that at the end each face has a different color as shown in figure 
notice that when a face is rotated the configuration of colors in all 

the adjacent faces changes figure illustrates a rotation of one of the 
  ces given a scrambled configuration reaching the final position can 
be quite challenging as you may know
