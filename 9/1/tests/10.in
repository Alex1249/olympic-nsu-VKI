indianajonesisina deserted city annihilated during a war roofs of
 all houses have been destroyed and only portions of walls are still
 standing the ground is so full of mines that the only safe way to 
move around the city is walking over the remaining walls the mission of 
our hero is to save a person who is trapped in the city in order to move 
¤tween two walls which are not connected indiana jones thought of taking 
with him a wooden board which he could place between the two walls and then 
cross from one to the other initial positions of indiana jones and the 
trapped person are both on some section of the walls besides walls are 
either in the direction southnorth or westeast you will be given a map 
of the city remains your mission is to determine the minimum length of 
the wooden board indiana jones needs to carry in order to get to the 
trapped person input your program should process several test cases 
each test case starts with an integer n indicating the number of wall 
sections remaining in the city each of the next n lines describes a wall
 section the first wall section to appear is the section where indiana 
jones stands at the beginning the second section to appear is the section 
where the trapped person stands each wall section description consists of 
three integers x y and l where x an y define either the southernmost point
 of a wall section for southnorth sections or the westernmost point for 
westeast wall sections the value of l determines the length and direction 
 the wall if l the section is westeast with length l if l the section is 
rthsouth with length the end of input is indicated by output for each test
 case in the input your program should produce one line of output containing 
a real value representing the length of the wooden board indiana jones must
 carry the length must be printed as a real number with twodigit precision 
and the last decimal digit must be rounded the input will not contain test 
cases where differences in rounding are significant
